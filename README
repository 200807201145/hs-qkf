A Quaternion Kalman Filter for Attitude Filtration

SUMMARY
------------

This program interfaces with an inertial sensor and estimates attitude using a quaternion Kalman filter based on Daniel Choukroun's "Novel Quaternion Kalman Filter" : http://ae-www.technion.ac.il/library/tae_view.php?id=5

It is written in Haskell, mostly because I wanted to learn Haskell. I liked using the hmatrix-static library because it assures there aren't too many bugs at compile time. 

It interfaces with a 3-axis magnetometer, accellerometer, and rate gyro sensor over a serial port. Software and documentation on the sensor can be found at http://moreproductive.org/autopilot and http://github.com/pchickey/p4l-ahrs

There is (or, will be) some code to rotate a cube on the screen to verify and demonstrate the filter.

DEPENDENCIES
------------

This program has been developed and tested with:

ghc 6.10
hmatrix-static 0.3
serialport 0.3.2
gnuplot 0.3.3.1

You may want to google for the hmatrix installation instructions to make sure you satisify library dependencies.

The Display directory uses:
opengl 2.4.0.1
glut 2.2.2.0
... but thats a mess of code I googled for at the moment. Hang tight.
