\title{Design of an Attitude and Heading Reference Sensor}
\author{Patrick Hickey\\pat@moreproductive.org}
\input{./title.tex}

\begin{abstract}
This paper describes the design of an Attitude and Heading Reference Sensor (AHRS), which measures rootational orientation relative to north and down. 
The design uses 3-axis accellerometer, magnetometer, and rate gyro sensors. 
I will discuss the selection and construction of the sensor hardware, design and implementation of a Kalman filter for sensor fusion, and the test of both the sensor hardware and software.
